    <h1>How to Care for a Pomeranian</h1>
    <p>Pomerian are Adorable companions and playful entertainers. They are small dogs that require regular grooming to keep their fluffy coats in good condition. Brush their coat a few times a week to prevent clumped masses, especially of hair or fabric. Feed them high-quality dog food in small portions to maintain their weight. Pomeranians are active and enjoy short walks and playtime indoors.</p>
