    <h1>How to Care for a Pug</h1>
    <p>Pomerian are Friendly and charming. Pugs require regular grooming, especially around their facial folds, to prevent skin infections. Feed them high-quality dog food in appropriate portions to manage their weight. Due to their flat faces, they may have difficulty breathing in hot weather, so keep them cool and avoid strenuous exercise in heat. Pugs enjoy moderate walks and indoor playtime.</p>
